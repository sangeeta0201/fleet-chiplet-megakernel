## Chapter 7. Matrix Arithmetic Instructions

Matrix core is an extension to CDNA architecture shader instruction set supporting the Machine Intelligence
SIMD. The matrix core has its own VGPR file: the Accumulation ("Acc") GPRs. This is separate from the normal
(Architectural, or "Arch") VGPRs in the original SIMD. Shader I/O can only use both types of VGPRs.
Instructions have an ACC bit to indicate if data is transferred to/from architectural or accumulation VGPRs.
Data can be moved between the ACC and ARCH VGPRs via the V_ACCVGPR_READ and V_ACCVGPR_WRITE
instructions.

The core operation implemented inside the matrix core is the 4 × 1 times 1 × 4 outer matrix product, yielding 16
output values. The outer product can be performed both on dense inputs and on 2,4 sparse ones (where two of
each set of four values is zero). The matrix core unit uses combinations of these operations, both in parallel
and in series, to implement the dense matrix-fused-multiply-add (MFMA) instructions described in Subsection
Matrix fused-multiply-add (MFMA) and their 2,4-sparse variants described in Subsection Sparse Matrices.

Because these matrix instructions do not produce their output in a single cycle, and since their partially-
written results may be observable, a certain amount of independent instructions must sometimes be present
between the issuance of a matrix core instruction and accesses to its results or modification of the registers
that hold its inputs, as described in Subsection Dependency Resolution: Required Independent Instructions.

   The AMD Matrix Instruction Calculator (https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/
   amd_matrix_instruction_calculator) contains a helper tool that allows developers to view detailed
   information about the MFMA instructions in the CDNA architecture. It allows users to query instruction-
   level information such as computational throughput and register usage. It also allows users to generate
   mappings between matrix element and hardware registers for each MFMA instruction and their
   modifiers.
```

### 7.1. Matrix fused-multiply-add (MFMA)

The matrix fused-multiply-add (MFMA) instructions use the matrix core to perform one or more matrix
multiplications. Note that the matrix core unit, which executes these instructions, has the 4 × 1 by 1 × 4 outer
product as its fundamental computational primitive, and so the MFMA instructions implement outer-product-
like operations.

These instructions all have names of the form V_MFMA_[output type]_[M]X[N]X[K][_[B]B]_[input type] where B
(which is 1 if not specified) is the number of matrices (or blocks) that are multiplied, and M, N, and K, are the
multiplication dimensions for each block. For example, the instruction V_MFMA_F32_32x32x1_2B_F32
perform the operations

```
  D[0,:,:] = C[0,:,:] + A[0,:,:] * B[0,:,:]
  D[1,:,:] = C[1,:,:] + A[1,:,:] * B[1,:,:]
```

where the D[b,:,:] and C[b,:,:] are 32 × 32 matrices of 32-bit floats, the A[b,:,:] are 32 × 1 matrices of floats,

and the B[b,:,:] are 1 × 32 matrices of floats.

The input and output values for an MFMA can be stored either in the standard architectural vector registers
(VGPRs) or accumulation VGPRs (AccVGPRs), which are additional registers exclusive to the matrix core unit.
The register file that the registers holding matrices A and B are controlled by the low and high bits,
respectively, of the ACC field of a MFMA instruction (0 for VGPRs, 1 for AccVGPRs), while the ACC_CD bit
determines if the C and D matrices are stored in VGPRs (0) or AccVGPRs (1). Data can be moved to and from
AGPRs using the V_ACCVGPR_* instructions.

Note that the registers holding input or output data for a MFMA instruction must be contiguous, and that the
first register must be aligned to the number of registers required as the input or output. For instance, if an
instruction requires four input registers for matrix A, registers 4 through 7 may be used (by setting SRC0 to 4)
but not registers 5 through 8.

#### 7.1.1. Notation

When indexing values that have multiple blocks, M[b,i,j] is the value in block b, row i, and column j of the
value M, where matrices are zero-indexed.

When describing the inputs and outputs of an MFMA operation, they are written as matrices with each column
representing a different lane in a wavefront and each row representing a different register (or logical item) that
a lane has.

For example, consider the following pair of matrices A

```
                                         A[0,0,0]         A[0,0,1]
                                         A[0,1,0]         A[0,1,1]
                                         …                …
                                         A[0,31,0]        A[0,31,1]
                                         ----             ----
                                         A[1,0,0]         A[0,0,1]
                                         …                …
                                         A[1,31,0]        A[1,31,1]
```

When the value is written as:

```
                             Lane 0      Lane 1      …           Lane 31     Lane 32    …        Lane 63
      Register 0             A[0,0,0]    A[0,1,0]    …           A[0,31,0]   A[1,0,0]   …        A[1,31,0]
      Register 1             A[0,0,1]    A[0,1,1]    …           A[0,31,1]   A[1,0,1]   …        A[1,31,1]
```

this means that each lane of a wavefront holds two values across two contiguous registers, which are the two
values of a row of one of the blocks of A, with the first 32 lanes holding a different row from block 0 and the
second 32 lanes holding successive rows of block 1.

This specification writes matrices in their storage layout.

When showing register layouts, this spec assumes the first register is 0.

Unless otherwise specified, the division operator rounds down (takes the floor).

#### 7.1.3. Usage examples

7.1.3.1. V_MFMA_F32_32X32X1_2B_F32
The first examples show MFMA usage in order to build an intuition for the general semantics of these
instructions.

Suppose the user wants do two matrix multiplications of 32 × 1 matrices A[b,:,:] by 1 × 32 matrices B[b,:,:],
accumulating the results into 32 × 32 matrices D[b,:,:].

The input register for A stores columns of A across successive lanes (that is, the i coordinate is the fastest-
moving) and has the form

```
                              Lane 0      Lane 1      …            Lane 31     Lane 32      …            Lane 63
        Register 0            A[0,0,0]    A[0,1,0]    …            A[0,31,0]   A[1,0,0]     …            A[1,31,0]
```

that is, lane l holds the value

```
  A[l / 32, l % 32, 0]
```

The layout for B holds rows of B in the same way that the A layout stores its columns. That is, B is stored with
lane l holding

```
  B[l / 32, 0, l % 32]
```

```
                              Lane 0      Lane 1      …            Lane 31     Lane 32      …            Lane 63
        Register 0            B[0,0,0]    B[0,0,1]    …            B[0,0,31]   B[1,0,0]     …            B[1,0,31]
```

The core component of the output layout is the 4 × N (where N is 32 here) tile of values. (The use of 4 × N tiles,
as opposed to a simpler layout, is a consequence of the matrix core's internal structure). As many of these tiles
as possible (here 2 of them) are packed into the lanes of each group of registers, going by row and then by

block.

That is, the layout of D (and the corresponding layout of C) is:

```
                          Lane 0          Lane 1         …         Lane 31          Lane 32         …       Lane 63
Register 0                D[0,0,0]        D[0,0,1]       …         D[0,0,31]        D[0,4,0]        …       D[0,4,31]
Register 1                D[0,1,0]        D[0,1,1]       …         D[0,1,31]        D[0,5,0]        …       D[0,5,31]
…                         …               …              …         …                …               …       …
Register 3                D[0,3,0]        D[0,3,1]       …         D[0,3,31]        D[0,7,0]        …       D[0,7,31]
Register 4                D[0,8,0]        D[0,8,1]       …         D[0,8,31]        D[0,12,0]       …       D[0,12,31]
…                         …               …              …         …                …               …       …
Register 15               D[0,27,0]       D[0,27,1]      …         D[0,27,31]       D[0,31,0]       …       D[0,31,31]
Register 16               D[1,0,0]        D[1,0,1]       …         D[1,0,31]        D[1,4,0]        …       D[1,4,31]
…                         …               …              …         …                …               …       …
Register 31               D[1,27,0]       D[1,27,1]      …         D[1,27,31]       D[1,31,0]       …       D[1,31,31]
```

In other words, the output value D[b, i, j] is located in lane

```
    l = j + 32 * ((i/4) % 2)
```

of output register

```
    r = 16b + 4(i / 8) + (i % 4)
```

In order to produce these results, the broadcast fields (CBSZ, ABID, and BLGP) must all be set to 0. The usage of
these fields is shown in Subsection Broadcasting values.

7.1.3.2. V_MFMA_F32_32X32X2_F32
As another example, consider the instruction V_MFMA_F32_32X32X2_F32. For this instruction, there is only
one block being multiplied, and the matrices A[0,:,:] and B[0,:,:] are 32 × 2 and 2 × 32 respectively.

This instruction takes one input register for each of A and B, which the same format as above, except that lanes
32-63 contain the second column of A (row of B) instead of the second block. The output layout is the same as
above, except that there is only one block and so there are only 16 output registers. More concretely, the input
and output layouts for V_MFMA_F32_32X32X2_F32 are

7.1.3.3. V_MFMA_F32_4X4X4_16B_F16
This example demonstrates how values that are not 32 bits long are packed into registers and how the output
format changes in the case where an entire matrix cannot fill all lanes in an output register group.

The V_MFMA_F32_4X4X4_16B_F16 instruction performs 16 block multiplications of the form

```
  D[b,:,:] = C[b,:,:] + A[b,:,:] * B[b,:,:]
```

where each block of A and B is a 4 × 4 block of half-precision floating point values and each block of C and D
holds 4 × 4 single-precision floats.

The instruction uses 2 registers to hold each of A and B, even though, following the input format principles
from the previous section, each lane needs to hold four values. This is because each input register holds two
half-precision values, with the second of those values in the upper bits (16-31) of the register.

That is, the input layout of A is

```
                              Lane 0      Lane 1      …         Lane 3       Lane 4      …           Lane 63
      Register 0[15:0]        A[0,0,0]    A[0,1,0]    …         A[0,3,0]     A[1,0,0]    …           A[15,3,0]
      Register 0[31:16]       A[0,0,1]    A[0,1,1]    …         A[0,3,1]     A[1,0,1]    …           A[15,3,1]
      Register 1[15:0]        A[0,0,2]    A[0,1,2]    …         A[0,3,2]     A[1,0,2]    …           A[15,3,2]
      Register 1[31:16]       A[0,0,3]    A[0,1,3]    …         A[0,3,3]     A[1,0,3]    …           A[15,3,3]
```

and for B is

```
                              Lane 0      Lane 1      …         Lane 3       Lane 4      …           Lane 63
      Register 0[15:0]        B[0,0,0]    B[0,0,1]    …         B[0,0,3]     B[1,0,0]    …           B[15,0,3]
      Register 0[31:16]       B[0,1,0]    B[0,1,1]    …         B[0,1,3]     B[1,1,0]    …           B[15,1,3]
      Register 1[15:0]        B[0,2,0]    B[0,2,1]    …         B[0,2,3]     B[1,2,0]    …           B[15,2,3]
      Register 1[31:16]       B[0,3,0]    B[0,3,1]    …         B[0,3,3]     B[1,3,0]    …           B[15,3,3]
```

The 16 4 × 4 output blocks of this instruction are arranged into four output registers as follows.

```
                              Lane 0      Lane 1      …         Lane 3       Lane 4      …           Lane 63
      Register 0              D[0,0,0]    D[0,0,1]    …         D[0,0,3]     D[1,0,0]    …           D[15,0,3]
      …                       …           …           …         …            …           …           …
      Register 3              D[0,3,0]    D[0,3,1]    …         D[0,3,3]     D[1,3,0]    …           D[15,3,3]
```

That is, because there are not enough groups of 4 rows available in a block to fill 64 lanes of output in each
register, successive blocks are used instead. Note that these outputs are 32-bit floats and so are not packed into
registers.

7.1.3.4. V_MFMA_F64_16X16X4_F64
This demonstrates how double-precision values are handled using the example of V_MFMA_F64_16X16X4_F64.
This instruction follows the same input layout patterns as the previous examples and operates most similarly to
V_MFMA_F32_32X32X2_F32. However, each input is spread across multiple registers in order to accommodate
the full 64-bit value.

The output of this instruction, and the other double-precision MFMA instructions, does not follow the 4 × N
block layout of other MFMA instructions. Instead, the output rows are packed contiguously across the lanes of
each wavefront, and then packed into pairs (to account for the 64 bits needed to store the output) of registers,
as shown below.

The input and output formats for V_MFMA_F64_16X16X4_F64 are

```
           Lane 0             Lane 1             …     Lane 15            Lane 16           …     Lane 63

#### 7.1.4. General input and output layout

In general, an MFMA instruction is parameterized by its input and output datatypes, the sizes M, N, and K of
each matrix block and the number of blocks it operates on B.

Semantically, for each 0 <= b < B, 0 <= i < M, and 0 <= j < N, it computes

```
  D[b,i,j] = C[b,i,j] + sum_{0 <= k < K} A[b,i,k] * B[b,k,j]
```

where each A[b,:,:] is M × K, each B[b,:,:] is K × N, and each D[b,:,:] and corresponding C[b,:,:] is M × N.

The values of the inputs and outputs are placed into the arguments to the instruction according to a fixed
layout. For simplicity, this layout is defined in terms of the lanes of a wavefront and of the sequence of items for
each lane: these items are arranged into the 32-bit registers that are the true arguments to an MFMA
instruction in little-endian form.

More specifically,

- For 64-bit quantities, each item corresponds to a pair of registers, with the low bits of the quantity in the first of those registers and high bits in the second one

- For 32-bit quantities, each item corresponds to a distinct register
- For 16-bit quantities, an item is half of a register, with the odd-numbered items taking up bits 31-16 and the even ones in bits 0-15
- For 8-bit quantities, four items are packed into a register, analogously to the 16-bit case
- For 4-bit quantities, eight items are packed into a register analogously to the 16- and 8-bit cases. That is, item 0 lives in bits 3-0 of the first register, item 1 is in bits 7-4 of the same register, and so on, until item 8 is placed in bits 3-0 of the following register."
- 6-bit quantities, like fp6 and bf6 values, are also densely packed into the registers that contain them. Because 6-bit quantities cannot be evenly packed into one 32-bit register, all instructions that take 6-bit inputs from lanes require them to be placed into six contiguous registers, and thus will require each lane to provide 32 values across those registers. If that group of 6 registers is treated as one 192-bit register, we can then describe item 0 as residing in bits 5-0 of that register, item 1 as being stored in bits 11-6, item 4 in bits 35-30 (note the crossing of the 32-bit register boundary) and so on."

7.1.4.1. Input layout
To define the input layout for the matrix A, first define the auxiliary constant

```
  K_L = K / (64 / (M * B))
```

which is the number of consecutive values of K that each lane holds in its registers.

For example, for the instruction V_MFMA_F32_32X32X1_2B_F32:

```
  K_L = 1 / (64 / (32 * 2)) = 1 / 1 = 1
```

and for V_MFMA_F32_32X32X2_F32:

```
  K_L = 2 / (64 / (32 * 1)) = 2 / 2 = 1
```

These both show that the one input register holds one value in the K dimension, but for
V_MFMA_F32_4X4X4_16B_F16:

```
  K_L = 4 / (64 / (4 * 16)) = 4 / 1 = 4
```

representing the fact that, for each lane, the two input registers hold four values in the K dimension. These
input values are packed little-endian. For example, the third value in each row (which has k = 2 zero-indexed),
is in bits 15:0 of the second input register for both A and B across all lanes. That 16-bit region is "item 2" in the
layout computed below for V_MFMA_F32_4X4X4_16B_F16.

Note that, in all MFMA instructions, the products M * B and N * B are less than 64, that is, the values of a single
column of A or row of B, considered over all blocks, fit within a single input item.

With this layout defined, a given input value A[b,i,k] is placed in the item

```
  k % K_L
```

of lane

```
  i + M * (b + B * (k / K_L))
```

The layout for B is the analogous function that places B[b,k,j] in item

```
  k % K_L
```

of lane

```
  j + N * (b + B * (k / K_L))
```

7.1.4.2. Output layout
The output values D[b,i,j] of an MFMA instruction, as well as the corresponding values C[b,i,j] of the matrix
to add to the result, are stored in a fixed layout that is a function of the MFMA instruction being used.

To define this layout, first define the following constants:

- H, the group height, which indicates how many consecutive rows of output are placed in each row group and which are therefore stored in consecutive items on a single lane. For f64 instructions, H = 1, but for all other MFMA instructions, H = 4.
- B_I = ceil(64 / (N * M / H)), the number of blocks stored in each output item (an item within the storage for D or C) across all lanes
- M_I = (64 / B_I) / N, the number of rows of D stored in each output item across all lanes
- G = M / (H * M_I), the number of row groups needed to store B_I blocks of output.

For example, using the instruction V_MFMA_F32_32X32X1_2B_F32 gives

```
  H = 4
  B_I = ceil(64 / (32 * 32 / H)) = ceil(64 / 256) = 1
  M_I = (64 / 1) / 32 = 2
  G = 32 / (4 * 2) = 4
```

while the instruction V_MFMA_F32_4X4X4_16B_F16 yields the values

```
  H = 4
  B_I = ceil(64 / (H * 4 / 4)) = ceil(64 / 4) = 16
  M_I = (64 / 16) / 4 = 4 / 4 = 1
  G = 4 / (H * 1) = 4 / 4 = 1
```

With these constants defined, the value D[b,i,j] of matrix D is located in item

```
  (i % H) + H * (i/(H * M_I) + G * (b / B_I))
```

on lane

```
  j + N * ((i / H) % M_I + M_I * (b % B_I))
```

#### 7.1.5. 8-bit and Smaller Matrix Operations and Layouts

There are two MFMA instructions which can independently select FP4, FP6 or FP6 for the A and B matrices:

```

#### 7.1.6. Broadcasting values

While the operation of multiplying a 32 × 1 matrix of floats A by a 1 × 64 matrix B is not available natively, one
can emulate this multiplication using the broadcast controls Control Broadcast SiZe (CBSZ), A Block ID (ABID),
and B Lane-Group Permutation (BLGP).

These controls impact the retrieval of values from lanes: after the lane l_a in which a particular element of A
would reside is computed, that value is permuted as defined by the CBSZ and ABID fields in order to determine
the lane that is accessed during the computation. Similarly, l_b, the lane to be used when retrieving any
particular value of B, is permuted in the manner specified by the BLGP field.

7.1.6.1. CBSZ and ABID
Together, the CBSZ and ABID fields control the broadcasting of the blocks of matrix A.

When the 3-bit CBSZ field is non-zero, one block of lanes broadcasts the values it holds for matrix A to the other
blocks of lanes, superseding the values those other lanes hold for the A matrix. Setting CBSZ such that (1 <<
CBSZ) exceeds the number of blocks the MFMA instruction processes is undefined.

The broadcast block size is

```
  S = 64 / (1 << CBSZ)
```

For example, if CBSZ is 1, then one block of 32 lanes provides the inputs to both groups of 32 lanes in the
wavefront, while CBSZ being 3 means that a the values from a block of 8 lanes are replicated.

The largest legal value of CBSZ is 4.

The 4-bit ABID field controls which block of S lanes is used as the broadcast source. The possible blocks are
numbered in order, with lanes S-1:0 being selected by ABID=0, 2S-1:S corresponding to ABID=1, and so on.
For example, if CBSZ=2, then ABID=1 means the values from lanes 16 to 31 are broadcast, to the three other
blocks of lanes, while ABID=3 means that lanes 48 to 63 serve as the source of their inputs.

It is not legal to set ABID such that ABID >= (1 << CBSZ), as such values do not refer to a potential source block.

Put differently, the CBSZ and ABID bits cause lane l_a to read thir inputs from the lane given by the
permutation

```
  p_a(l_a) = (l_a % S) + (S * ABID)
```

As a full example, if CBSZ=1 and ABID=1 when using the instruction V_MFMA_F32_32X32X1_2B_F32, both 1 ×
32 blocks of B are multiplied by the values in the second 32 × 1 block of A, which is stored by the first 32 lanes.
That is, the operation becomes:

```
  D[b,i,j] = C[b,i,j] + A[1,i,0] * B[b,0,j]
```

which is a 32 × 1 by 1 × 64 matrix multiplication if the two blocks of B are treated as one matrix with 64 rows.

7.1.6.2. Alternate meaning of CBSZ field for F8F6F4 instructions
V_MFMA_F32_*_F8F6F4 use CBSZ to indicate the data type, and behave as if BLGP==0 in terms of data
broadcasting.

7.1.6.3. BLGP
The 3-bit BLGP field selects how the lane from which values in matrix B are read is permuted. Once it is
determined that some value B[b,k,j] is in item r on lane l_b, using the defined input layout, the lane to be
accessed l_b is permuted depending on the BLGP field as shown in Table Permutations corresponding to BLGP
values.

The MFMA instructions that operate on double-precision floats (f64) do not support the broadcasting methods
described above.

These instructions ignore CBSZ and ABID.

The BLGP field is repurposed for signaling the negation of the matrices A, B, and C.

- BLGP[0] causes values from matrix A to be implicitly negated if set
- BLGP[1] causes values from matrix B to be implicitly negated if set
- BLGP[2] causes values from matrix C to be implicitly negated if set

7.1.6.5. Alternate meaning of broadcast fields for F8F6F4 instructions
V_MFMA_F32_*_F8F6F4 use BLGP to indicate the data type, and behave as if BLGP==0 in terms of data
broadcasting.

### 7.2. Block Scaled Matrices

Matrix block scaling associates a unique scale factor with a block of matrix values in the K dimension. For the
operations describe here, the block size is 32. Block scaled data format are: F4, F6, and F8.

The scale factor is an exponent-offset, encoded as an 8-bit exponent (bias 127) with valid values in: -127, 127
(0xFF is NaN).

The figure below gives an illustrative example of block scaling, assuming a tiled matrix multiplication
operation of D = A x B + C, where A is of shape (M x K), B is of shape (K x N), and C/D is of shape M x N. The row
and column scale factors, Ax and Bx, are vectors of dimension M and N, respectively, that store the scale
factors that are needed for computing D. In the example below where M=K=N=S=4, scale factors are provided
with every 1x4 row of matrix A and every 4x1 column of matrix B. During dot product operations, the scales are
applied after the normal dot product prior to output/accumulation.

#### 7.2.1. MFMA with Block Exponent Scaling

Scale values are set for MFMA with 4-dword instructions that combine a "Load-Scale factors" and MFMA
functions into one instruction:
V_MFMA_SCALE_F32_16X16X128_F8F6F4, V_MFMA_SCALE_F32_32X32X64_F8F6F4.

The scale value is used just for one instruction and does not carry forward into non-"scale" MFMA ops.

The 4-DWORD instruction is constructed in a manner that looks like two back-to-back VOP3P's, where the first
holds has the constant 0xD3AC across what is normally the ENCODING through OPCODE fields, and the second
VOP3P has OP = V_MFMA_SCALE_F32_16X16X128_F8F6F4 or V_MFMA_SCALE_F32_32X32X64_F8F6F4.

Operands of Load-Scale (first 2 DWORDs of "SCALE" ops):

```
ENCODING             0xCC35 in bits [31:16]
SRC0                 Matrix A scale
                     {OP_SEL_HI [0], OP_SEL[0]} defines which part of scale is used by the Matrix A of MFMA instruction.
SRC1                 Matrix B scale
                     {OP_SEL_HI [1], OP_SEL[1]} defines which part of scale is used by the Matrix B of MFMA instruction.
Scale for F4/6/8 matrix (2-bit OPSEL codes):
00: Src[7:0] Lane 0-63 is the scale to be used
01: Src[15:8] Lane 0-63 is the scale to be used
10: Src[23:16] Lane 0-63 is the scale to be used
11: Src[31:24] Lane 0-63 is the scale to be used
```

Scale values (SRC0 and SRC1) can be either VGPRs or Inline constants (floats, using only the exponent portion).

For the V_MFMA_F32_16x16x128_F8F6F4 op, the K dimension is 128. There is one scale value for every 32 K-
dimension values: 128/32 = 4 scale values per matrix row. The M and N dimensions are 16, so there are 16 rows.
This means in total the matrix needs 16 * 4 = 64 8-bit scale values. This comes from one-quarter of one VGPR
across 64 lanes.

See the next section for the list of MFMA operations which support SCALE.

All of the instructions in the table above use VOP3.

Note: VOP3 instructions may not use SDWA.

In the above table, the CVT_*_F32 instructions do not support 4-cycle forwarding on these operations. The user
must insert a NOP or instruction writing some other destination VREG between the conversions writing the
low/high half or bytes of the same destination register.

Convert instructions come in two types:
- Packed - convert two 8-bit values into 32-bit values per instruction
- Stochastic Round - one source has the number to convert and the other has a random number used in rounding
  - These ops add a random value from the specified VGPR and then truncate to the smaller result data

type
  - For convert ops requiring a Stochastic Rounding Value over multiple passes, an updated random number is generated every pass.
    - Multipass: FP32, FP16 or BF16 to FP4 or FP6
    - The VGPR holding the PRNG is not updated; the new pseudo-random value is created internally via V_PRNG_B32 but not written

Converts from 8-bit formats and SDWA in VOP1:
- SRC0 must be set to "SDWA", and the SRC0 VGPR is specified in the SDWA word as is the SRC0_SELECT which specifies which bytes to be converted. The other SDWA fields are ignored.

Converts with Scale:
- Conversion from F4/F6/F8 do not support input modifiers
- Conversion from F32 supports MODE-based denormal control; F4/F6/F8 allows denorms regardless of MODE
- Conversion to F4/F6 does not support FP16_OVFL, while to F8 does
- Convert ops do not support OMOD or DPP
- The scale is an E8M0 exponent with a bias of 127
- The scale can come from a VGPR or an inline-constant (float exponent portion is used).

If a value exceeds the FP4/FP6 representable range after rounding, the value is clamped/saturated to the
maximum FP4/FP6 magnitude, preserving the sign. During conversion to FP4/FP6, if a value has magnitude
less than the minimum subnormal magnitude of FP4/FP6 after rounding, the value is converted to zero.

CVT_SR_FP8_F32 and CVT_SR_BF8_F32 OP_SEL usage:

```
   Op_sel[3:2] == 00: dest_vgpr[31:0] = {prev_dst_vgpr[31:8], result[7:0]}
   Op_sel[3:2] == 01: dest_vgpr[31:0] = {prev_dst_vgpr[31:16], result[7:0], prev_dst_vgpr[7:0]}
   Op_sel[3:2] == 10: dest_vgpr[31:0] = {prev_dst_vgpr[31:24], result[7:0], prev_dst_vgpr[15:0]}
   Op_sel[3:2] == 11: dest_vgpr[31:0] = {result[7:0], prev_dst_vgpr[23:0]}
```

CVT_SR_FP8_F32 OP_SEL usage:

```
   Uses Src0 and Src1 as inputs supplied by the VOP3 encoding, it adds the two operands with attention to
   not use msbs of src1 mantissa based on opcode and dependent on the F8 data type for the stochastic
   round before converting to F8 type. Then OP_SEL bits 3 and 2 are repurposed for this 8b write op and
   used to steer the resulting 8 bits into the correct byte lane of the 32b output preserving the remaining 24b
   of the destination.
```

```
CVT_*FP8_F32 and CVT*_BF8_F32 FP16_OVFL rule
   The FP16_OVFL flag is applied to data conversions from F32 to FP8/BF8 formats. The overflow behaviour is
   specified in the table below:
```

CVT_SR_* and CVT_PK_* support only VGPRs as inputs, not SGPRs, literal or inline constants.

```

```

The register SH_MEM_CONFIG, bit[8] must be set to 1 to produce the correct results for BF8 and FP8
operations.

### 7.4. Floating-point handling details and formats

The handling of denormal numbers varies depending on the datatypes the instruction takes and, in some
cases, the MODE flags.

- V_MFMA_F32_*_F32 instructions, which take 32-bit inputs, honor the denormal-handling flags in MODE
- Matrix-C input and result-matrix output ignore MODE.denorm and do not flush denormals
- All instructions that take floats whose size is less than 32-bits (F16, BF16, BF8, FP8) ignore MODE.denorm and do not flush denormals
- The V_MFMA_F64_*_F64 instructions, which take 64-bit inputs and outputs ignores MODE and rounds to nearest even and allows denorms in the input and output
- The V_MFMA_I32_*_I8 perform integer multiply-add and thus do not respect the MODE bits. The 16-bit results of multiplying the I8 input values are sign-extended to 32 bits before multiplication, and the 16-bit result of the multiplication is sign extended to 32 bits prior to being added to the 32-bit result

The matrix core unit does not support arithmetic exceptions, except for DGEMM matrix operation which does
support exceptions.

### 7.5. Sparse Matrices

The V_SMFMAC family of instructions perform matrix multiply-accumulate operations on a 4:2 structurally-
sparse matrix A and dense matrices B, C, and D: D = C + A × B.

The A matrix is represented using 4:2 structured sparsity which means that two out of every 4 elements along
the matrix K-dimension are zero. These zeros are not stored directly but instead are described in a separate
VGPR which holds pairs of 2-bit index values. The index values indicate which two values out of each group of
4 are non-zero and are used to reconstruct full A-matrix. Non-zero samples are tightly packed resulting in 2:1
compression. Only the A-matrix may be sparse.

These SMFMAC instructions are all "accumulate" ops, where the C and D matrices are identical, referenced by
the instruction's VDST field (D-matrix). The C operand input is repurposed to hold the index data offset.

Matrix A is structurally sparse and occupies two VGPRs per lane at srcA offset. Matrix B is dense and occupies
four VGPRs per lane at srcB offset. Matrix C shares VGPR offset with destination argument and occupies 16
VGPRs.

```
16-bit source data
   If CBSZ[1:0] =0, ABID[1:0] selects one of four 8-bit sets of sparse-indices within a VGPR starting at srcC
   containing 8-bits of index information for a lane. If CBSZ[1:0] !=0; the very first is selected
   (VGPR[srcC][7..0]).
```

```
8-bit source data
   If CBSZ[1:0] =0, ABID[0] selects one of two 16-bit sets of sparse-indices within a VGPR starting at srcC
   containing 16-bits of index information for a lane. If CBSZ[1:0] !=0; the very first is selected
   (VGPR[srcC][15..0]).
```

All SMFMAC instructions must follow these restrictions:

```
 1. The Matrix A is sparse matrix and matrix B is the dense matrix. The ALU loads twice more data from VGPR
    for matrix B comparing with matrix A.
 2. Matrix C is the same as the result Matrix. The ALU uses the VDST VGPR to load matrix C. All instructions
    are encoded as accumulation opcodes.
 3. Src2 has the index encoded (all of the indexes are in one VGPR) and it can only be VGPR. Index Data
    provides information about which 2 out 4 SRCA are non-zero. For this index pair, index 0 < index 1 &
    index0 != index1.
 4. The VGPR address of Src0, src1 and VDST must be even aligned.
 5. CBSZ and ABID controls are ONLY used to pick the index from the VGPR read and don't affect SRCA matrix
    broadcast etc. as defined for other MFMA opcodes that use CBSZ and ABID controls.
```

SMFMAC instructions interpret the ACC_CD differently from other instructions: For SMFMAC the ACC_CD bit
control only the DEST vgpr (arch vs accum), not the SRC2 location. The SRC2 argument provides the index data
for sparse data supplied by the SRC0 argument which must reside in the ARCH-vgprs along with the A and B
matrix data. In other words SRC2 acts as if ACC_CD==0.

```
Denorm Control               ignores Denorm Control from MODE and keep Input/Output Denorms.
Clamp                        Supported. uses the FP16_OVFL bit from MODE.
                             If set, F32 Result on overflow is clamped to +/- MAX, otherwise the overflow result is
                             normalized to +/-INF.
                             If set, I32 Result is clamped to +/-MAX on overflow/underflow, otherwise the carry out bits
                             are dropped.
FP16_Ovfl                    Once the FP16_OVFL is set, F32 overflow result is clamped to +/- MAX, otherwise the
                             overflow result is normalized to +/-INF.
Round Mode                   ignores Round Mode from MODE and forces it to RNE.
Exceptions                   Not Supported
Execution Mask               ignores exec mask from MODE and forces it to 1 for all threads

#### 7.5.1. Details of Sparsity Structure

Every index for the matrix B selection is a 2-bit number which identifies one of K=4 is selected. Depending on
the matrix B layout, SRC2 may hold multiple sets of indices.

7.5.1.1. 16-bit A/B Matrix
When the A and B matrices consist of 16-bit data (FP16, BF16), the rules below apply.

When the A and B matrices consist of 8-bit data (I8, FP8, BF8), the rules below apply.

**Table 36. Matrix B Layout**

Each lane has K=16 values which requires 8 indices per lane (16 bits), so each SRC2 VGPR holds 2 sets of
indices.
