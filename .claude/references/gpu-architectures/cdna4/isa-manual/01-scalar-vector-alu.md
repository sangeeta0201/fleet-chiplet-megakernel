## Chapter 5. Scalar ALU Operations

Scalar ALU (SALU) instructions operate on a single value per wavefront. These operations consist of 32-bit
integer arithmetic and 32- or 64-bit bit-wise operations. The SALU also can perform operations directly on the
Program Counter, allowing the program to create a call stack in SGPRs. Many operations also set the Scalar
Condition Code bit (SCC) to indicate the result of a comparison, a carry-out, or whether the instruction result
was zero.

### 5.1. SALU Instruction Formats

SALU instructions are encoded in one of five microcode formats, shown below:

Each of these instruction formats uses some of these fields:

```
Field                    Description
OP                       Opcode: instruction to be executed.
SDST                     Destination SGPR.
SSRC0                    First source operand.
SSRC1                    Second source operand.
SIMM16                   Signed immediate 16-bit integer constant.
```

The lists of similar instructions sometimes use a condensed form using curly braces { } to express a list of
possible names. For example, S_AND_{B32, B64} defines two legal instructions: S_AND_B32 and S_AND_B64.

### 5.2. Scalar ALU Operands

Valid operands of SALU instructions are:

- SGPRs, including trap temporary SGPRs.
- Mode register.
- Status register (read-only).
- M0 register.
- TrapSts register.

- EXEC mask.
- VCC mask.
- SCC.
- PC.
- Inline constants: integers from -16 to 64, and a some floating point values.
- VCCZ, EXECZ, and SCC.
- Hardware registers.
- 32-bit literal constant.

In the table below, 0-127 can be used as scalar sources or destinations; 128-255 can only be used as sources.

```

The SALU cannot use VGPRs or LDS. SALU instructions can use a 32-bit literal constant. This constant is part of
the instruction stream and is available to all SALU microcode formats except SOPP and SOPK. Literal constants
are used by setting the source instruction field to "literal" (255), and then the following instruction dword is
used as the source value.

If any source SGPR is out-of-range, the value of SGPR0 is used instead.

If the destination SGPR is out-of-range, no SGPR is written with the result. However, SCC and EXEC (for
saveexec) are written.

If an instruction uses 64-bit data in SGPRs, the SGPR pair must be aligned to an even boundary. For example, it
is legal to use SGPRs 2 and 3 or 8 and 9 (but not 11 and 12) to represent 64-bit data.

### 5.3. Scalar Condition Code (SCC)

The scalar condition code (SCC) is written as a result of executing most SALU instructions.

The SCC is set by many instructions:

- Compare operations: 1 = true.
- Arithmetic operations: 1 = carry out.
  - SCC = overflow for signed add and subtract operations. For add, overflow = both operands are of the same sign, and the MSB (sign bit) of the result is different than the sign of the operands. For subtract (AB), overflow = A and B have opposite signs and the resulting sign is not the same as the sign of A.
- Bit/logical operations: 1 = result was not zero.

### 5.4. Integer Arithmetic Instructions

This section describes the arithmetic operations supplied by the SALU. The table below shows the scalar
integer arithmetic instructions:

**Table 14. Integer Arithmetic Instructions**

```

```

### 5.5. Conditional Instructions

Conditional instructions use the SCC flag to determine whether to perform the operation, or (for CSELECT)
which source operand to use.

**Table 15. Conditional Instructions**

```
Instruction                Encoding Sets SCC? Operation
S_CSELECT_{B32, B64}       SOP2          n            D = SCC ? S0 : S1.
S_CMOVK_I32                SOPK          n            if (SCC) D = signext(simm16).
S_CMOV_{B32,B64}           SOP1          n            if (SCC) D = S0, else NOP.
```

### 5.6. Comparison Instructions

These instructions compare two values and set the SCC to 1 if the comparison yielded a TRUE result.

**Table 16. Conditional Instructions**

```
Instruction                            Encoding       Sets SCC?      Operation

```

### 5.7. Bit-Wise Instructions

Bit-wise instructions operate on 32- or 64-bit data without interpreting it has having a type. For bit-wise
operations if noted in the table below, SCC is set if the result is nonzero.

## Chapter 6. Vector ALU Operations

Vector ALU instructions (VALU) perform an arithmetic or logical operation on data for each of 64 threads and
write results back to VGPRs, SGPRs or the EXEC mask.

### 6.1. Microcode Encodings

Most VALU instructions are available in two encodings: VOP3 which uses 64-bits of instruction and has the full
range of capabilities, and one of three 32-bit encodings that offer a restricted set of capabilities. A few
instructions are only available in the VOP3 encoding.

When an instruction is available in two microcode formats, it is up to the user to decide which to use. It is
recommended to use the 32-bit encoding whenever possible.

The microcode encodings are shown below.

VOP2 is for instructions with two inputs and a single vector destination. Instructions that have a carry-out
implicitly write the carry-out to the VCC register.

VOP1 is for instructions with no inputs or a single input and one destination.

VOPC is for comparison instructions.

VOP3 is for instructions with up to three inputs, input modifiers (negate and absolute value), and output
modifiers. There are two forms of VOP3: one which uses a scalar destination field (used only for div_scale,
integer add and subtract); this is designated VOP3b. All other instructions use the common form, designated
VOP3a.

Any of the 32-bit microcode formats may use a 32-bit literal constant, but not VOP3.

VOP3P is for instructions that use "packed math": They perform the operation on a pair of input values that are
packed into the high and low 16-bits of each operand; the two 16-bit results are written to a single VGPR as two
packed values.

VOP3P-MAI is a variation of the VOP3P format for use with the Matrix Arithmetic Instructions (MAI).

### 6.2. Operands

All VALU instructions take at least one input operand (except V_NOP and V_CLREXCP). The data-size of the
operands is explicitly defined in the name of the instruction. For example, V_MUL_F32 operates on 32-bit
floating point data.

#### 6.2.1. Instruction Inputs

VALU instructions can use any of the following sources for input, subject to restrictions listed below:

- VGPRs.
- SGPRs.
- Inline constants - constant selected by a specific VSRC value.
- Literal constant - 32-bit value in the instruction stream. When a literal constant is used with a 64bit instruction, the literal is expanded to 64 bits by: padding the LSBs with zeros for floats, padding the MSBs with zeros for unsigned ints, and by sign-extending signed ints.
- M0.
- EXEC mask.

Limitations

- At most one SGPR can be read per instruction, but the value can be used for more than one operand.
- At most one literal constant can be used, and only when an SGPR or M0 is not used as a source.

```
    Limitations for Constants
       VALU "ADDC", "SUBB" and CNDMASK all implicitly use an
       SGPR value (VCC), so these instructions cannot use an additional SGPR or literal constant.
```

Instructions using the VOP3 form and also using floating-point inputs have the option of applying absolute
value (ABS field) or negate (NEG field) to any of the input operands.

```
Limitations for SDWA and OPSEL
   DOT instructions must not use SDWA or OPSEL.
   VALU ops which use SDWA or OPSEL must not consume the result of that instruction in the next VALU
   instruction - there must be at least on independent instruction or V_NOP between them.
```

6.2.1.1. Literal Expansion to 64 bits
Literal constants are 32-bits, but they can be used as sources which normally require 64-bit data:

- 64 bit float: the lower 32-bit are padded with zero.
- 64-bit unsigned integer: zero extended to 64 bits
- 64-bit signed integer: sign extended to 64 bits

#### 6.2.2. Instruction Outputs

VALU instructions typically write their results to VGPRs specified in the VDST field of the microcode word. A
thread only writes a result if the associated bit in the EXEC mask is set to 1.

All V_CMPX instructions write the result of their comparison (one bit per thread) to both an SGPR (or VCC) and
the EXEC mask.

Instructions producing a carry-out (integer add and subtract) write their result to VCC when used in the VOP2
form, and to an arbitrary SGPR-pair when used in the VOP3 form.

When the VOP3 form is used, instructions with a floating-point result can apply an output modifier (OMOD
field) that multiplies the result by: 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 or 4.0. Optionally, the result can be clamped (CLAMP field) to
the range [0.0, +1.0].

Output modifiers apply only to floating point results and are ignored for integer or bit results. Output modifiers
are not compatible with output denormals: if output denormals are enabled, then output modifiers are
ignored. If output denormals are disabled, then the output modifier is applied and denormals are flushed to
zero. Output modifiers are not IEEE compatible: -0 is flushed to +0. Output modifiers are ignored if the IEEE
mode bit is set to 1.

In the table below, all codes can be used when the vector source is nine bits; codes 0 to 255 can be the scalar
source if it is eight bits; codes 0 to 127 can be the scalar source if it is seven bits; and codes 256 to 511 can be the
vector source or destination.

#### 6.2.3. Out-of-Range GPRs

When a source VGPR is out-of-range, the instruction uses as input the value from VGPR0.

When the destination GPR is out-of-range, the instruction executes but does not write the results.

### 6.4. Denormalized and Rounding Modes

The shader program has explicit control over the rounding mode applied and the handling of denormalized
inputs and results. The MODE register is set using the S_SETREG instruction; it has separate bits for controlling
the behavior of single and double-precision floating-point numbers.

Note: that V_DOT2 instructions operating on floating point data do not support denormal and rounding modes.
They flush input and output denorms.

**Table 26. Round and Denormal Modes**

```
Field             Bit Position          Description
FP_ROUND          3:0                   [1:0] Single-precision round mode.
                                        [3:2] Double/Half-precision round mode.
                                        Round Modes: 0=nearest even; 1= +infinity; 2= -infinity, 3= toward zero.
FP_DENORM         7:4                   [5:4] Single-precision denormal mode.
                                        [7:6] Double/Half-precision denormal mode.
                                        Denormal modes:
                                        0 = Flush input and output denorms.
                                        1 = Allow input denorms, flush output denorms.
                                        2 = Flush input denorms, allow output denorms.
                                        3 = Allow input and output denorms.
```

### 6.5. ALU Clamp Bit Usage

When using V_CMP instructions, setting the clamp bit to 1 indicates that the compare signals if a floating point
exception occurs. For integer operations, it clamps the result to the largest and smallest representable value.
For floating point operations, it clamps the result to the range: [0.0, 1.0].

### 6.6. VGPR Indexing

VGPR Indexing allows a value stored in the M0 register to act as an index into the VGPRs either for the source
or destination registers in VALU instructions.

#### 6.6.1. Indexing Instructions

The table below describes the instructions which enable, disable and control VGPR indexing.

**Table 27. VGPR Indexing Instructions**

```
Instruction                      Encoding        Sets SCC? Operation
S_SET_GPR_IDX_OFF                SOPP            N          Disable VGPR indexing mode. Sets: mode.gpr_idx_en = 0.
S_SET_GPR_IDX_ON                 SOPC            N          Enable VGPR indexing, and set the index value and mode from
                                                            an SGPR. mode.gpr_idx_en = 1
                                                            M0[7:0] = S0.u[7:0]
                                                            M0[15:12] = SIMM4
S_SET_GPR_IDX_IDX                SOP1            N          Set the VGPR index value:
                                                            M0[7:0] = S0.u[7:0]
```

```
Instruction                       Encoding         Sets SCC? Operation
S_SET_GPR_IDX_MODE                SOPP             N          Change the VGPR indexing mode, which is stored in
                                                              M0[15:12].
                                                              M0[15:12] = SIMM4
```

Indexing is enabled and disabled by a bit in the MODE register: gpr_idx_en. When enabled, two fields from M0
are used to determine the index value and what it applies to:

- M0[7:0] holds the unsigned index value, added to selected source or destination VGPR addresses.
- M0[15:12] holds a four-bit mask indicating to which source or destination the index is applied.
  - M0[15] = dest_enable.
  - M0[14] = src2_enable.
  - M0[13] = src1_enable.
  - M0[12] = src0_enable.

Indexing only works on VGPR source and destinations, not on inline constants or SGPRs. It is illegal for the
index attempt to address VGPRs that are out of range.

#### 6.6.2. VGPR Indexing Details

This section describes how VGPR indexing is applied to instructions that use source and destination registers in
unusual ways. The table below shows which M0 bits control indexing of the sources and destination registers
for these specific instructions.

```

                                                                                      (dst)     (s2)      (s1)     (s0)
v_readlane                  sdst = src0, SS1                                          x         x         x        src0
v_readfirstlane             sdst = func(src0)                                         x         x         x        src0
v_writelane                 dst = func(ss0, ss1)                                      dst       x         x        x
v_mac_*                     dst = src0 * src1 + dst      mad: dst, src0, src1, src2   dst, s2   x         src1     src0
v_madak                     dst = src0 * src1 + imm      mad: dst, src0, src1, src2   dst       x         src1     src0
v_madmk                     dst = S0 * imm + src1        mad: dst, src0, src1, src2   dst       src2      x        src0
v_*sh*_rev                  dst = S1 << S0               <shift> (src1, src0)         dst       x         src1     src0
v_cvt_pkaccum               uses dst as src2                                          dst, s2   x         src1     src0
SDWA (dest preserve,        uses dst as src2 for read-                                          dst, s2
sub-Dword mask)             mod-write
```

where:
src= vector source
SS = scalar source
dst = vector destination
sdst = scalar destination

### 6.7. Packed Math

CDNA supports packed math, which performs operations on two 16-bit values within a Dword as if they were
separate elements. For example, a packed add of V0=V1+V2 is really two separate adds: adding the low 16 bits
of each Dword and storing the result in the low 16 bits of V0, and adding the high halves.

Packed math uses the instructions below and the microcode format "VOP3P". This format adds op_sel and neg
fields for both the low and high operands, and removes ABS and OMOD.

Packed Math Opcodes:

```
              V_PK_MAD_I16             V_PK_MUL_LO_U16       V_PK_ADD_I16            V_PK_SUB_I16
              V_PK_LSHLREV_B16         V_PK_LSHRREV_B16      V_PK_ASHRREV_I16        V_PK_MAX_I16

```

#### 6.7.1. Packed Convert

All convert opcodes operating on FP6/BF6/FP4 data must use VGPR sources for any operand slots providing
more than 32-bits of data.

Convert instructions with SCALE add an 8-bit exponent bias (E8M0, bias of 127) to each F4/F6/F8 value. Each
exponent bias is shared by a block of 32 values along the K dimension.

For example, conversion from FP32 to FP6 (16x16x128):
- Source data is in VGPRs 0..31, with K=0..31 for M=0 in lane0, M=1 in lane1 etc up to M=15 in lane 15; then K=32..63 in lanes 16..31; K=64..96 in lanes 32..48; and K=96..127 in lanes 48..63.
- Result data is in VGPRs 0..5, with K and M distributed similarly (lanes0..15 has K=0..31 and M=0..15).
- Exponent biases: the VGPR holds one set of exponent biases in bits [30:23] (typical float32 exponent position).
