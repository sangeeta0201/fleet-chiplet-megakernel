// Fused W13+SwiGLU+W2 MoE gang kernel for MI350 (gfx950).
//
// Single gang task replaces separate W13+SwiGLU and W2 tasks.
// Uses in-kernel atomicAdd barrier between phases (no extra event dispatch).
//
// Barrier layout, per expert (see MOE_BAR_* below).
//
// Every slot gets its own 64-byte cache line. That is not padding for
// performance -- it is required for correctness. The release fan-out uses
// st_wt (sc0 sc1), which bypasses L2 and lands in HBM, while the arrival
// counter is an ordinary L2-resident atomic read-modify-write. If the two
// share a line, the L2 copy still holding the *old* release values can be
// written back over the fresh write-through data, silently reverting slots
// that were already released, and the W2 workers for that expert then wait
// forever on a release that did happen. The sibling barrier in
// gang_linear_mxfp4_res_bias_rmsnorm_topk_mi300.cuh has always spaced its
// slots this way; this one packed all eight releases plus the counter into a
// single line, which is the deadlock captured at 32k.
//
// Phase-ordered tile encoding (all W13 before all W2):
//   global_tile ∈ [0, num_activated * W13_TILES):  W13+SwiGLU phase
//   global_tile ∈ [num_activated * W13_TILES, total):  W2 phase
//
// This ensures workers exhaust all W13 tiles before reaching W2 tiles,
// avoiding spin-wait blocking while W13 work remains.
// Per-expert atomicAdd barrier: W2 for expert E starts once all W13
// tiles for expert E complete across all XCDs.
//
// Supports different OUTPUT_PER_WG for W13 and W2 phases.
