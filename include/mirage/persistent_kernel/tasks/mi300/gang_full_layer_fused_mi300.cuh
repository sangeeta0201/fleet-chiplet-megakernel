// Full-layer fused gang task for MI300/MI350.
//
// Combines task 214 (QKV+Attn) and task 215 (O-proj+TopK+MoE) into ONE
// gang task per transformer decoder layer, eliminating one inter-task
// event barrier and one scheduler dispatch per layer.
//
// 8-phase pipeline (single dispatch, all 240 workers stay alive):
//   Phase 1: QKV GEMM          — workers 0..(qkv_tiles_per_xcd-1) per XCD
//   Phase 2: QKV barrier       — epoch-based, all QKV workers wait
//   Phase 3: Parallel attention — workers 0..(NUM_KV_CHUNKS-1) each run one
//   chunk Phase 4: Chunk barrier      — last chunk worker runs merge inline
//   Phase 5: Merge + flush     — merge_splitkv_ck_fmha → bf16, write-through,
//   signal Phase 6: Cross-XCD barrier — all 30 workers poll attn_global Phase
//   7: O-proj + RMSNorm + Router + TopK Phase 8: MoE (W13+SwiGLU+W2)
//
// Counter buffer slot map (extends type 215's layout):
//   oproj_counters_ptr + 0..18*16-1  : type 215's counters
//   oproj_counters_ptr + 19*16       : attn_global_counter (cross-XCD sync)
//   oproj_counters_ptr + 20*16       : qkv_epoch[0..7] per-XCD epoch flags
//   oproj_counters_ptr + 28*16       : chunk_barrier[0..7] per-XCD chunk
//   arrival
//
// Stack-frame optimization: input/output pointers are NOT unpacked into
// local variables. Instead, input_ptrs[N] and output_ptrs[N] are accessed
// directly, saving ~272 bytes of stack frame per thread.

  // Layer-boundary ACQUIRE for moe_workspace_f32. Plain `buffer_inv` (vL1

  //
  // ── Why vL1-only is sufficient here, and how that was established ────────
  //
  // This site and four others (see the back-references below) were `sc1`
  // (vL1 + L2). The reasoning was: W2 writes the workspace with `st_wt_f32x4`
  // (sc0 sc1), bypassing L2 into HBM; the producing tile is on a different
  // XCD; MI300/MI350 L2 is not coherent across XCDs; so a line this XCD still
  // holds from last layer's read of the same address would be served stale
  // out of L2.
  //
  // Every step of that is true about the *hardware*. What it omits is the
  // Phase 9 layer barrier at the end of this function, which did not exist
  // when these were written. Phase 9 is a global all-XCD rendezvous whose
  // release path drains stores (`s_waitcnt vmcnt(0)`) and fans out
  // write-through flags. No worker can reach this line for layer N+1 until
  // every worker has passed Phase 9 for layer N, by which point the producers'
  // write-through stores have retired to HBM. The stale-L2 window the `sc1`
  // was closing is a window Phase 9 already closes.
  //
  // Measured, not argued from the memory model. Ablated at HEAD across five
  // configurations, every run compared bitwise against an unablated reference:
  //
  //   B=8 x 5 runs, B=1 x 3 runs, B=16 x 3 runs, 36 layers, 200 positions
  //     -> all KV caches and all output tokens bitwise identical, and
  //        bitwise identical to the `sc1` build. Same arithmetic, not merely
  //        a different-but-stable answer.
  //   `--max-layers 2` x 4 runs at B=8 -> also identical. This one is the
  //        load-bearing check: a 36-layer run streams ~1.7 GB of MoE weights
  //        through a ~4 MB L2 per layer, so a stale line might simply be
  //        evicted by capacity pressure rather than by any guarantee, which
  //        would make the result accidental. At 2 layers that pressure is
  //        largely gone and a stale line can survive. It still matched.
  //
  // Cost recovered: 3.455 -> 2.527 ms/iter at B=1, seq 512 (-27%). The five
  // sites are not individually free (0.03-0.27 ms each) but they overlap; the
  // combined figure is the one that matters.
  //
  // ── What would invalidate this ───────────────────────────────────────────
  //
  // The dependency is on Phase 9. If the layer barrier is weakened, moved
  // above a workspace consumer, or removed, these five sites must go back to
  // `sc1` -- or the ablation must be re-run. Phase 9 is not optional for its
  // own sake either: removing it fails this same gate immediately and loudly
  // (all 72 KV tensors differ, output tokens differ, every run).
  //
  // Note this is an ablation result, not a proof. It says removal is harmless
  // across every gate above; it does not derive safety from the memory model.
  //
  // MPK_W2_CONSUMER_GATE is exactly the "weakened" case this warning names, so
  // under that flag the acquire moves to the consumer gate in Phase 1 and goes
  // back to `sc1`. See the gate site for the full argument.
  //
  // ── The bs>1 arm: one system-scope acquire for the whole layer ────────────
  //
  // Everything above is a bs=1 argument. It leans on Phase 9 having drained
  // every producer's write-through stores before any consumer reaches this
  // line, which is true for the workspace but says nothing about data
  // published *within* a layer by one XCD and read by another -- and at bs>1
  // there is such data: rmsnorm_out_moe, written by one router worker per XCD
  // with a plain global_store into that XCD's non-coherent L2, then read in
  // Phase 8 by workers that never entered Phase 7 (xcd_rank >=
  // oproj_topk_tiles_per_xcd) and so never touched the line on their own die.
  //
  // That was the bs>1 MoE W13 corruption. It was first fixed with a scoped
  // `sc1` at the Phase 7b acquire, patching the one site that reproduced.
  // What ships instead is one system-scope acquire for the whole layer, and
  // the difference in shape is the point.
  //
  // Why the broad form is preferable to the narrow patch: the per-site fix is
  // only known-correct at the site that happened to reproduce. This file has
  // seven bare `buffer_inv` sites, all argued safe from bs=1 ablations, and
  // the bs=4 evidence shows how weak that kind of argument is here -- with the
  // scoped fix REMOVED, bs=4 still reports 0/720 bad weight groups across
  // three reps, not because it is safe but because twelve active experts
  // stream enough MXFP4 weight to evict the stale line by L2 capacity before
  // it is read. The same capacity accident the `--max-layers 2` ablation above
  // was designed to defeat. Correctness that depends on cache pressure is not
  // correctness, so gate a coherence fix at the LOWEST batch that reproduces
  // (bs=2 here), never the highest: bad-group counts fall 30 / 27 / 0 as the
  // batch grows.
  //
  // Cost: `sc0 sc1` here drops L2 once per layer, at a point where the layer is
  // about to stream its weights in anyway, rather than mid-Phase-7 after the
  // MXFP4 expert weights are already resident -- which is what made the
  // unconditional form at that site cost +0.259 ms/token. QKV_BATCH_SIZE is a
  // template parameter, so the bs=1 build compiles to exactly the `#else` and

  // Measured, 2 layers at bs=2, against an offline MXFP4+SwiGLU oracle with
  // the error normalized by the per-slot scale: the corrupt W13 weight groups
  // are exactly the tiles owned by xcd_rank >= 23, in three separate
  // geometries --
  //
  //   workers/XCD 31 -> skippers 23..30 -> corrupt ranks 26..30 -> 33/360 bad
  //   workers/XCD 26 -> skippers 23..25 -> corrupt ranks 23..25 -> 14/360 bad
  //   workers/XCD 23 -> skippers none   -> corrupt ranks none   ->  0/360 bad
  //
  // Ranks 16..22 also skip the RMSNorm (`local_tile >= router_tile_n`, 16) and
  // are clean in every config, so the discriminator is entering this barrier,
  // not running the norm.
  //
  // bs=1 is clean because the Phase 7 kernel's per-token loop is a
  // compile-time 1 there and its closing __syncthreads compiles out, so there
  // is no partially written multi-token row to catch. The corrupt reads are
  // uncorrelated noise that scores *worse* than all-zeros, which is what a
  // half-filled row looks like -- not a coherent wrong input.
  //
  // Arrival is unchanged: these workers have no O-proj columns to publish, so
  // they must not bump the counter (`tiles_per_xcd` arrivals per XCD is what
  // the release fires on, and an extra arrival would desynchronize the
  // modular release). They only wait.
  //
  // ── This is a PARTIAL fix; the rest of the race is still open ─────────

  // Matched control in one build, gate vs MPK_NO_OPROJ_SKIP_GATE=1: 32 bad
  // weight groups against 52, with XCDs 4 and 5 going 12+8 -> 0. Real, and
  // reproducible. But XCDs 1, 6 and 7 are untouched, and the residual sits in
  // expert slots 4 and 5 -- the last two *real* slots of the 8-slot
  // MAX_ACTIVATED space at bs=2 (6 real, 2 padding).
  //
  // The reason this cannot be the whole fix: the barrier polled here releases
  // *before* the RMSNorm that writes rmsnorm_out_moe, which runs afterwards in
  // the Phase 7 kernel's own Phase 3. So it orders the O-proj columns, not the
  // normed row. What makes the residual genuinely puzzling is that Phase 7b
  // below already polls routing_ready, which the router workers publish only
  // after draining their norm stores -- if that release were sufficient there
  // would be no residual at all, so something about it does not order the norm
  // for these consumers.
  //
  // rmsnorm_out_moe is *correct* in the final dump (max err 0.0039 against a
  // 0.35 scale, zero bad elements) while swiglu_out is wrong, so the MoE reads
  // it transiently before it settles. The buffer is fine; the ordering is not.
  //
  // Counts move run to run (33/22/32/32 across reps at the shipped geometry),
  // so do not size a change here off a single run -- always rebuild with the
  // ablation flag and compare inside one build.

  // architectural NOP. `sc1` invalidates L2; `sc0 sc1` is system scope.
  // The disassembly confirms this is the understood rule elsewhere in the

  // So this instruction does nothing, and that is fine *here*: everything the
  // poll gates -- active_expert_ids / routing_indices / topk_weight -- is
  // written st_wt (sc0 sc1) straight to HBM, bypassing L2, and needs no
  // invalidate to be seen.
  //
  // What is NOT fine, and was the bs>1 MoE W13 corruption, is that Phase 8
  // also reads rmsnorm_out_moe, which under MPK_ONE_NORM_WRITER is published
  // by one router worker *per XCD* with a plain global_store into that XCD's
  // non-coherent L2. That line needs a real acquire, and this NOP was standing
  // in for one. What that line needs, and what the branch below gives it, is
  // an `sc1` invalidate. Applying it to every worker here is correct -- it
  // takes the bs=2 two-layer dump from 32 bad weight groups to 0/360 -- but
  // costs +0.259 ms/token (2.196 vs 1.937 at ctx 512), because dropping all of
  // L2 also throws away the streamed MXFP4 expert weights Phase 8 is about to
  // read. So it is applied only to the workers that need it.
  //
  // Which workers those are is not a guess. The corrupt tiles were exactly the
  // ranks at or past oproj_topk_tiles_per_xcd -- {23..28} at the shipped
  // geometry -- the same set the Phase 7a' gate above singles out, because
  // those are the workers that never entered Phase 7 and so never touched the
  // norm row on their own die. Every other rank read it while producing it.
  //
  // A cheaper form was tried and does not work: passing NT_LOAD to the W13
  // activation gather. `__builtin_nontemporal_load` emits the `nt` cache-
  // replacement hint, not a coherence scope, and left 30 of 32 groups bad.
  //
  // How the defect was localized, since the shape is worth recognizing again:
  // it hit 100% of the affected weight groups on XCDs 1, 6 and 7 and 0% on the
  // other five, was bit-identical under MPK_MOE_ENTRY_DELAY=2000 (2000 x
  // s_sleep(127) before Phase 8), and was unchanged by making the producer's
  // store write-through. A defect that survives an unbounded consumer delay
  // and a write-through producer, while staying deterministic per XCD, is a
  // consumer-side stale line -- not a race, and not a producer visibility gap.
  //
  // The acquire rmsnorm_out_moe needs is NO LONGER HERE. It moved to the top
  // of the layer, as a single `buffer_inv sc0 sc1` under QKV_BATCH_SIZE > 1.
  // See the long note at that site for why the layer-top form is preferred to

  // accumulator race *within* a layer. What was missing is the guarantee that
  // the writer has run *at all* before the next layer reads.
  //
  // Nothing provided it. All 36 layers run inside one persistent dispatch (the

  //
  //     if (threadIdx.x == 0 && block_xcd_local_rank == 0) threadfence_gpu();
  //     __syncthreads();
  //
  // Both are per-workgroup. `__syncthreads` synchronizes the 256 threads of
  // *this* block and says nothing about the other 239 workers, and
  // `threadfence_gpu` is a memory *ordering* fence, not a rendezvous -- it
  // makes this worker's prior writes visible if someone reads them later, but
  // it never makes anyone wait. So a workgroup that finished its MoE tiles
  // could roll straight into layer N+1 and read workspace slots belonging to
  // tokens whose W2 tiles were still executing on another XCD.
  //
  // The result is not a hang and not garbage: the reader gets the *previous*
  // layer's value for those elements (the buffer is deliberately never zeroed
  // -- coverage is total, so nothing clears it), which is a plausible-looking
  // float. Which elements lose the race depends on inter-XCD timing, so it
  // varies run to run. That is precisely the observed signature: layer 0's K/V

  // just been zeroed and there is no prior value to read, while layer 1 -- the
  // first layer with a real predecessor -- diverges at decode step 0.
