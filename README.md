GPT-OSS 120B (128-expert top-4 MoE, MXFP4 weights, FP8 activations) as a Mirage Persistent Kernel on AMD **MI350/MI355 (gfx950)**, batch size 1 (almost 2X faster than vllm). Like the existing Qwen model, it runs as an MPK **megakernel** -- but where Qwen dispatches the forward pass as **many tasks**, here **we fuse all 36 layers into a single task**: embedding through logits executes in one persistent loop over the 8 XCDs, never returning to the host.

Per op, precision is chosen for the hardware. QKV, O-proj, and the MoE experts (W13/W2) run **FP8 activations x MXFP4 weights** on the block-scaled matrix core **`v_mfma_scale_f32_16x16x128_f8f6f4`**, with FP4 weights unpacked by the hardware **`v_cvt_scalef32_pk_bf16_fp4`** intrinsic (this alone was 10.7 -> 5.2 ms). Attention runs in BF16 via CK-FMHA split-KV; the router+TopK and a fused **MXFP4 LM head + argmax** close each layer. GEMM inputs use XOR-swizzled LDS addressing and pipelined MFMA loops.

Feeding those matrix cores without stalls is the other half of the story, and **weight prefetching** is central: weights stream **HBM->LDS directly via `buffer_load_lds`**, bypassing the VGPR file, and are **prefetched a stage ahead** so expert-weight HBM traffic hides behind compute and synchronization instead of stalling on it -- the O-proj weights load while the cross-XCD attention barrier drains, and the W2 (down-projection) weights and scales are pulled during the W13->W2 handoff. Synchronization is then reduced to a **fleet hierarchical barrier** (240-way -> 8-way) plus per-XCD monotonic flag polling that replaces `__syncthreads`, with pre-filled worker queues removing the scheduler from the loop. Correctness is checked by a tolerant Torch-vs-Mirage token test (`tests/ci-tests/`).

## Quickstart: running GPT-OSS 120B

Requires an AMD ROCm GPU (gfx950 / MI350 / MI355) for the HIP megakernel.

### Build from source

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
pip install -e . -v
export MIRAGE_HOME=$(pwd)
```

### Run (batch size 1)

```bash
export MODEL_PATH=/path/to/gpt-oss-120b   # local GPT-OSS 120B weights (or HF repo id)
export GPU=0                              # target GPU id

rm -rf demo/gpt_oss/permanent_output_dir
HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$GPU \
python3 demo/gpt_oss/demo.py --use-mirage \
  --model-path "$MODEL_PATH" \
  --prompt "Tell me the history of america" \
  --max-seq-length 512
```

Read the **`Decode avg`** line for per-token decode latency (~2.0 ms/tok). Drop
`--use-mirage` to run the PyTorch reference instead.

GPT-OSS 120B supports **up to 16 tokens per iteration** in a single request
(`--max-num-batched-tokens 1..16`). Tokens ride the N axis of the
`16x16x128` scaled-MFMA instruction, which was already computing 16 columns for
one token, so the dense GEMMs cost the same for 16 tokens as for 1 and only the
MoE grows — with the number of *distinct* experts the batch activates, not with
the token count. Measured prefill: 2.09 / 4.06 / 5.11 / 6.55 / 8.51 ms at
1 / 2 / 4 / 8 / 16 tokens, i.e. 16 tokens for 4.1x the cost of one. Multiple
concurrent *requests* (`--max-num-batched-requests > 1`) are not supported yet;
attention still assumes a single KV cache.

### Correctness test (Torch vs Mirage)

```bash
MODEL_PATH=/path/to/gpt-oss-120b bash tests/ci-tests/run_ci_tests_gpt_oss.sh
```

See [`demo/gpt_oss/README.md`](demo/gpt_oss/README.md) for the full set of options
(prompt selection, build variants, environment, and notes).
